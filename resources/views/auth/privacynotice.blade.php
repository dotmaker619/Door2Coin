                <li><b>Withdraw consent.</b> Where you have consented to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once your consent is withdrawn, the processing of your data will be halted, unless said processing is found on another legitimate basis, for example due to a legal obligation to keep your data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><strong>Your rights under certain circumstances.</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Right to information.<br>
                    You may request to know whether we hold any of your personal data, and, if so, information on the Company, what type of data we process and why/how we are processing it.</li>
                <li>Right of access.<br>
                    This right is giving you the opportunity to request and receive a copy of your personal data and check that the processing is lawful.</li>
                <li>Right to rectification.<br>
                    You have the right to request rectification of the information that we hold. You have also the right to ask us to complete any incomplete data we may hold.</li>
                <li>Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’).<br>
                    You may request that your personal data is deleted, provided that you meet the legal criteria for this request. Generally, you may request to be forgotten if the processing is unnecessary, unlawful, illegitimate, or you have objected to it. Note that since the majority of the processing performed by the Company is based on legal requirement, your request to be forgotten may be legally rejected by the Company.</li>
                <li>Object to processing of your personal information.<br>
                    If we are processing your data based on our (or a third party’s) legitimate interest and you are in a particular situation which gives you reason to object to the processing, you may submit this request. You may also object if we are processing your data for direct marketing purposes. If you lodge an objection, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms.</li>
                <li>Object to automated decision-making including profiling.<br>
                    You may object to any automated decisions or profiling taken and performed by us based on your personal data.</li>
                <li>Right to restriction.<br>
                    You may request the restriction of the processing of your data under some circumstances, for example, to determine if the data is accurate or to establish the reason for processing it.</li>
                <li>Right to data portability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This right only applies to information that you have given to us. You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us from one organization to another or give it to you. The right only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or under, or in talks about entering into a contract and the processing is automated.</p>
            <p>Please contact the Company’s Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:info@door2coin.com">info@door2coin.com</a> if you wish to exercise your rights. We may apply identification verification measures to you in order to ensure that no personal data is disclosed to unauthorized persons.</p>
            <p>Unless your requests are manifestly unreasonable or excessively burdensome, you shall not be charged a fee by the Company. In such cases your requests may also be denied, as they may not be submitted in good faith.</p>
            <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2>
            <p>We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical, technical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification.

            <p>When applicable, your data shall be securely deleted and/or destroyed and shall not be recoverable. We shall not notify you upon deletion as we will have no contact details to reach you.</p>
            <p>If we anonymize your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you it shall not be considered personal data as per the definition of the Law and we may keep that information without further notice to you.</p>
